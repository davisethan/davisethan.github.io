I am pursuing a PhD in building scalable and reliable machine learning systems that draw on probabilistic models, distributed systems, and high performance computing. At the University of Washington I research uncertainty aware deep learning to strengthen AI deployed in safety critical applications. I have seven years of industry experience as a software engineer, building distributed systems, scalable cloud infrastructure, and resilient data pipelines.

# Education

**M.S. Computer Science, University of Washington, 2024–2026**  
**B.S. Computer Science, Oregon State University, 2020–2022**  
**B.S. Mathematics, University of Portland, 2011–2015**

# Research Experience

At the University of Washington, my research goal is to determine when Bayesian learning benefits real-time motor imagery electroencephalography (MI-EEG) brain–computer interfaces (BCIs). To support this, I am designing a framework that collects a suite of metrics and diagnostics for evaluating machine learning models. These data enable multiple hypotheses to be formally generated and tested.

# Teaching & Mentoring

Assisting Prof. Erika Parsons in updating the course _Mathematics for Machine Learning_, including curriculum design, textbook selection, and assignment development and grading. Independently of the course, I curated MI-EEG BCI research directions and reproducibility standards (MOABB, Riemannian pipelines, GNNs) to align lab efforts and accelerate studies.

# Selected Industry Experience

**Software Engineer**, SeekOut – Bellevue, WA (2022–2024)  
Built and optimized data pipelines and distributed systems in C# and Azure, applying object-oriented design, SOLID principles, and automated testing to improve scalability, reliability, and maintainability of large-scale ETL and search infrastructure.

**Software Engineer**, Independent Project – Seattle, WA (2017–2020)  
Designed a fault-tolerant, microservices-based web application using Java, Spring Boot, Node.js, and AWS, implementing distributed systems principles for scalable cloud deployment.

**Software Engineer**, StackBrew – Redmond, WA (2015–2017)  
Developed a JavaScript AST interpreter and backend microservices (Node.js, Go) deployed on GCP, exploring collaborative editing algorithms (OT and CRDTs) to inform distributed software design.
