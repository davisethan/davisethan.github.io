## System Design

![System Design](./media/system_design.png)

I gained experience designing cloud services such as blog storage, distributed caches, and distributed messaging queues, understanding their architectural principles and tradeoffs. I also studied how to leverage these services to build large-scale applications like YouTube, Google Maps, and Uber, exploring their scalability, reliability, and performance requirements. Additionally, I examined the design of real-world distributed systems including Google File System (GFS), Google BigTable, and critical consensus algorithms like Paxos and Raft, deepening my understanding of fault tolerance, consistency, and distributed coordination in modern cloud infrastructures.
